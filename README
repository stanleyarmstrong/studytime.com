I used a Mac Mini with MacOS to make a javascript file. The Javascript powers the functionality of the site.
It writes how much time is remaining in a study session. The study.js is the program and the study.html is how you would view results and things like that.
It's main purpose is to display a time on screen and hide elements on an html page.
The seconds, minutes, and hours are displayed in the console as well.
It also powers the html, buttons functionality.
